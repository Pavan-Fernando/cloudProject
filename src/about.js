           <br/>
           <p>Launched in 2010, Our technology platform connects customers, restaurant partners and delivery partners, serving their multiple needs. Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, read and write customer generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make payments while dining-out at restaurants. On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business while also providing a reliable and efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners. We also provide our delivery partners with transparent and flexible earning opportunities.</p>

           <p>Dining options are many with the verandah overlooking the beautiful garden offering al fresco dining under the impressive marquee; or dine upstairs in one of the 4 Private dining rooms, or the balcony. Alternatively, the menu is an ode to all that is fresh, delicious and wonderful about Italian food, including Homemade Pasta , wood-fired Pizza selection and also gluten free dishes mindful of our guests preferences. The Bayleafâ€™s Executive Chef, Saroj, brings in over 20 years of experience working in international chains of Italian restaurants to provide that homely authentic Italian flavours in the menu. It also offers a Delivery and Take away menu to enjoy fine Italian food in the convenience of your home.</p>
